MATLAB version 2014b (System: Intel Core i5-7200U @ 2.5GHz, 64-bit, 8 GB RAM) 

NOTE: RUN EACH CODE (Ass1_Q1.m and Ass1_Q2.m) SECTION BY SECTION by pressing RUN SECTION or using CTRL+ENTER. 

Q1
	* Open file Ass1_Q1.m and run as mentioned in the note above.
	* The first section will print the values of gaussian kernel with different standard deviations(1,3 and 20). {Part (a) of Q1}
	* Next section convolves each image('butterfly.jpg') with the kernel made above and the output is shown. {Part (b) of Q1}
	* If you want to perform gaussian blur on other images, you can run the next two sections(on resized images '3_1.jpg' and '7_1.jpg')

Q2
	* Open file Ass1_Q2.m and run as mentioned in the note above.
	* The first section will print the values of Difference of Gaussian kernel.{Part (a) of Q2}
	* The next section will convolve the kernel made above with a gray-scale image('butterfly.jpg') and output is stored in a variable.{Part (b) of Q2}
	* Next section will detect zero crossings of the filtered image and show the output. {Part (b) of Q3}
	* The following sections perform the filtering on big images('3_1.jpg' and '7_1.jpg'). The binary output is saved as .jpg so that original resolution is retained and zero crossings are more clearly visualised.

There are also many other .m files which contain functions that have been called in Ass1_Q1.m and Ass1_Q2.m.
